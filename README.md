# Email Tracking and Notification System
Made by Youssef EL MANSOURI

![Logo]([https://elmansouri-port.github.io/assets/project-2.jpeg])
## Overview

This project consists of two Python scripts: `sender.py` and `server_track.py`. The `sender.py` script sends emails to a list of recipients and logs the status of each email sent. The `server_track.py` script is a Flask web server that serves image files and tracks when recipients open the emails, sending a notification when an email is opened.
